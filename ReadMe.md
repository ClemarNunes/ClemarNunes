# üí´ About Me:

I am a passionate front-end developer with over 3 years of experience, having embarked on my journey in 2021. Throughout this time, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to work on diverse projects that have helped me build a solid foundation in core web technologies, including **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

As my skills evolved, I embraced modern development tools and frameworks such as **Git**, **TypeScript**, **React**, and **Next.js**, which allowed me to tackle more complex projects with greater efficiency. Recently, I‚Äôve expanded my expertise by incorporating **SASS**, enabling me to create well-structured, scalable, and maintainable stylesheets.

In every project I undertake, my focus is on crafting intuitive, responsive interfaces that ensure seamless user experiences across all devices and screen sizes. I thrive in collaborative environments, where I can contribute to team efforts, share knowledge, and continuously push myself to innovate. I am always eager to take on new challenges that allow me to grow as a developer and contribute meaningfully to the web development ecosystem.
